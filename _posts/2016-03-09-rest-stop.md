# Rest Stop

[Rest Stop][0]: A classic episode from the genius producers at [This American Life][1]. As billed on the epidsode description: "Nine radio producers. Two days. One rest stop on the New York State Thruway." These guys somehow find the most interesting people and tell their stories in a way that give you a feeling of Americana and nostalgia.
