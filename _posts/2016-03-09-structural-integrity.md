# Structural Integrity

[Roman Mars][0] via [99% Invisible][1] brings us the story about an audacious architecture undergrad who discovers a critical design flaw in a 59 story highrise in New York City. This story blows my mind thinking about "what could have been" if the winds were strong enough.

Makes you appreciate engineers and everything they have to worry about when making a building.
